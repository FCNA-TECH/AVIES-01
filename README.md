# AVIES-01
I made this project after watching Spider-Man: Homecoming because Peter Parkers suit had an AI called Karen in it and I wanted to make my own AI (Personal Assistant in this case) so then using my skills and knowledge at the time I made AVIES-01. A system that allows you to measure the local temperature and humidity along with the distance of an object. I will update this program with more advanced features and functionality in the future and hopefully one day put it inside a Spider-Man suit. The parts you will need for this project are: An Arduino board, an Ultrasonic sensor, a 16x2 LCD screen, a keypad and finally a DHT11 sensor.
